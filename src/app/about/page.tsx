            paragraph="Veritate aims to showcase high school research across all STEM disciplines through both papers and posters. At
          Veritate, we recognize that many students engage in research but often
          lack a platform to share their work. Veritate provides an accessible
          space for publication, free from the constraints of traditional
          journalsâ€”students can publish without any costs or lab affiliation.
          Our platform is designed to be inclusive, ensuring that research is
          communicated in an understandable way, while still maintaining quality
          through rigorous peer and editorial review."
