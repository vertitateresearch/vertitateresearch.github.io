        Poster Guidelines for Submission
      </h2>
      <p>
        To facilitate a constructive review of your poster, please ensure that
        your work fulfills the following requirements.
      </p>
      <h3 id="submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Include a 150-200-word, non-technical summary of your research.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This summary is given in a different field in the submission form.
              It is submitted in text, not as a file.
            </li>
            <li>
              The summary should be different from the abstract. The summary
              should outline the main points of your research in an engaging
              manner that can be easily read and understood by a non-expert.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A summary should focus on the conclusions of your research, while
                the abstract often also briefly describes the methods and details
                of the study.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To ensure integrity of review, please either submit an anonymized
            copy of the poster (no name/personal identifier in the header,
            footer, or body). Alternatively, provide an editable version so we
            can redact your identifiers when sending for review.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="poster-formatting">Poster Formatting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Submission may not exceed 1 page, including all figures/tables and
            references.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As such, references should be limited to few key references.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The aspect ratio of the poster should be 16:9 (the default size for
            Google Slides).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The work should be submitted in .pdf format.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We prefer that the manuscript be prepared using an editing program
            such as Google Slides. If your work is produced in software such as
            LaTeX, please only include a PDF file.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="structure-and-style">Structure and Style</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Writing should be clear, logical, and free from typographical or
            grammatical errors.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The appropriate structure of submissions will vary depending on the
            research field.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In general, your poster submission might include sections for an
              Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References,
              and Figures/Tables.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="figures-and-tables">Figures and Tables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Figures and tables should be incorporated into the body of the
            poster for readability.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If a poster is selected for publication, the editorial staff will
              request high-resolution figures if the current figures are deemed
              low-resolution.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            All figures must be appropriately referenced in the text and include
            legends in text format. For plots and graphs, axes should be clearly
            marked and legible.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
