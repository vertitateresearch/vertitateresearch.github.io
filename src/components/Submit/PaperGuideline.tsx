        Paper Guidelines for Submission
      </h2>
      <p>
        To facilitate a constructive review of your manuscript, please ensure that
        your work fulfills the following requirements.
      </p>
      <h3 id="submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Include a 150-200-word, non-technical summary of the manuscript.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This summary is given in a different field in the submission form.
              It is submitted in text, not as a file.
            </li>
            <li>
              The summary should be different from the abstract. The summary
              should outline the main points of your manuscript in an engaging
              manner that can be easily read and understood by a non-expert.
            </li>
            <li>
              A summary should focus on the conclusions of your research, while
              the abstract often also briefly describes the methods and details of
              the manuscript.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Submit an abstract within the manuscript file at the beginning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To ensure the integrity of the review, please submit an anonymized
            copy of the manuscript (no name/personal identifier in the header,
            footer, or body) or provide an editable version so we can redact your
            identifiers when sending it for review.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="manuscript-formatting">Manuscript Formatting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Manuscript should follow APA formatting.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Submission may not exceed 30 pages, including all figures/tables and
            references.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If additional space is needed, please prepare a Supplementary
              Materials document containing additional accompanying text, figures,
              and tables.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The work should be submitted in .docx, .doc, or .pdf format.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We prefer that the manuscript be prepared using a word-editing program
            such as Word or Google Docs. If your work is produced in software such
            as LaTeX, please include your source files. If your work is selected
            for publication, you will be asked to format it in text form.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="structure-and-style">Structure and Style</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Writing should be clear, logical, and free from typographical or
            grammatical errors.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The appropriate structure of submissions will vary depending on the
            research field. However, the manuscript should be similar in style and
            structure to typical articles published in professional journals.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In general, your manuscript submission might include sections for an
              Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References,
              and Figures/Tables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supplementary Materials may be submitted along with the manuscript
              in a different file.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="figures-and-tables">Figures and Tables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Figures may be incorporated into the body of the text for readability,
            at the end of the work, or in a supplementary file/folder.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Submitting an additional folder of high-resolution figure files is
              much appreciated and will make your work look better in the
              publication!
            </li>
            <li>
              If a manuscript is selected for publication, the editorial staff
              will request high-resolution figures if the current figures are
              deemed low-resolution.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            All figures must be appropriately referenced in the text and include
            legends in text format. For plots and graphs, axes should be clearly
            marked and legible.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Tables should be submitted in text format.</p></li>
