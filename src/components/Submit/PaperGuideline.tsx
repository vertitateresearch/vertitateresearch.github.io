        Paper Guidelines for Submission
      </h2>
      <p>
        To facilitate a constructive review of your manuscript, please ensure
        that your work fulfills the following requirements.
      </p>
      <h3 id="submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Include a 150-200-word, non-technical summary of the manuscript.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This summary is given in a different field in the submission form.
              It is submitted in text, not as a file.
            </li>
            <li>
              The summary should be different from the abstract. The summary
              should outline the main points of your manuscript in an engaging
              manner that can be easily read and understood by a non-expert.
            </li>
            <li>
              A summary should focus on the conclusions of your research, while
              the abstract often also briefly describes the methods and details
              of the manuscript.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Submit an abstract within the manuscript file at the beginning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To ensure the integrity of the review, please submit an anonymized
            copy of the manuscript (no name/personal identifier in the header,
            footer, or body) or provide an editable version so we can redact
            your identifiers when sending it for review.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="manuscript-formatting">Manuscript Formatting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Manuscript should follow APA formatting.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Submission may not exceed 30 pages, including all figures/tables and
            references.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If additional space is needed, please prepare a Supplementary
              Materials document containing additional accompanying text,
              figures, and tables.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The work should be submitted in .docx, .doc, or .pdf format.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We prefer that the manuscript be prepared using a word-editing
            program such as Word or Google Docs. If your work is produced in
            software such as LaTeX, please include your source files. If your
            work is selected for publication, you will be asked to format it in
            text form.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="structure-and-style">Structure and Style</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Writing should be clear, logical, and free from typographical or
            grammatical errors.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The appropriate structure of submissions will vary depending on the
            research field. However, the manuscript should be similar in style
            and structure to typical articles published in professional
            journals.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In general, your manuscript submission might include sections for
              an Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion,
              References, and Figures/Tables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supplementary Materials may be submitted along with the manuscript
              in a different file.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="figures-and-tables">Figures and Tables</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Figures and tables may be incorporated into the body of the text for
            readability, at the end of the work, or in a supplementary
            file/folder.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Submitting an additional folder of high-resolution figure files is
              much appreciated and will make your work look better in the
              publication!
            </li>
            <li>
              If a manuscript is selected for publication, the editorial staff
              will request high-resolution figures if the current figures are
              deemed low-resolution.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            All figures must be appropriately referenced in the text and include
            legends in text format. For plots and graphs, axes should be clearly
            marked and legible.
          </p>
        </li>
